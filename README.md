# Week-1
This Jupyter Notebook implements a deep learning model for classifying electronic waste (e-waste) into 10 different categories using TensorFlow and EfficientNetV2B0. The project demonstrates a complete workflow from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.
# Key Features
- Dataset: Uses a custom e-waste dataset with 10 categories (Battery, Keyboard, Microwave, Mobile, Mouse, PCB, Player, Printer, Television, Washing Machine)
  
- Model Architecture: Implements transfer learning with EfficientNetV2B0 as the base model

- Data Visualization: Includes exploratory data analysis with sample image visualization

- Model Evaluation: Provides classification reports and confusion matrices for performance assessment

- Deployment: Includes Gradio interface for model deployment and real-time classification
